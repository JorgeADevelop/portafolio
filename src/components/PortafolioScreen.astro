            projectType="web"
            description="We worked closely with the government of Denmark to develop a system aimed at encouraging citizens to use public transportation in the city. This was achieved by creating a web-based administrator where administrators could select highly trafficked areas within the city and assign a cost to those zones. Cameras were integrated into these areas to monitor citizen traffic, and through a mobile application, citizens could pay based on the amount of time they spent within the zone."
